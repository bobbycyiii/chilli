These are the listings from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04236) with
[Stephan Tillmann](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/tillmann), 
in which we show that Cooper and Long's extension to
convex projective structures of Epstein and Penner's decomposition of
Teichmuller space is a cell decomposition.
